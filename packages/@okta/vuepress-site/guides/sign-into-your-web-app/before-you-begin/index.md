title: Before You Begin

This guide shows you how to use Okta as the user store for your web application and sign users in. 

These instructions are for web applications that have pages rendered by a server. If that's not what you are building, see these guides instead:

* For browser-based JavaScript apps, see [Sign Users into Your Single-Page Application](/guides/sign-into-spa).
* For mobile apps, see [Sign Users into Your Mobile App](/guides/sign-into-mobile-app).
* For servers that return API responses instead of pages, see [Protect Your API Endpoints](/guides/protect-your-api).

This guide assumes that you:

* Have an Okta Developer organization. If you don't, you can get one here: <https://developer.okta.com/signup>
* Have a project or application that you want to add authentication to.

If you don't have an app created, or are new to creating an app, start here:

Or, if you'd prefer to download a complete sample application:

If you meet all of the prerequisites, then you can move on to the first step, which is creating an Okta application.
